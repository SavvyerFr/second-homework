        <img src="img/1.jpg" alt="Grenn arrow fly">
        <p>Spoiled billionaire <strong>Oliver Queen</strong> came home with an entirely different personality—and a newfound purpose in life.<br>
        Completely <em>self-absorbed and never caring about anything but himself</em>, <strong>Queen</strong> was on a leisurely sailing trip when <br>
        his assistant betrayed him, leaving him for dead on a desolate remote island. Stranded, he survived by, amongst <br>
        other things, mastering a bow and arrow. When he eventually discovered the primitive locals that shared the island<br>
        with him, he uncovered a large conglomerate sadistically exploiting and enslaving them. Ollie used his new skills of<br>
        <small>survival and archery to lead a rebellion— only to realize how similar his opponents</small> were to the man he used to be.</p><br><br>
        <p><i>His band</i></p>
